Project Information:
This is the first time I ever worked in C++.
It has a couple experimental scripts that I was playing around with e.g. (Enemy.h/cpp)

This project was done almost a year ago, I've improved a lot since then.
It is included in this repo to show the progress I've made.

There is only one game mode as I didn't have time to make another (it was a stretch goal which I started implementing with my menu)
Controls:
	Menu:
		Navigate using arrow keys / w/s/a/d
		If an option has <<< >>> it means you can change its setting using arrow keys or a/d
		To start the game/open high score table/ quit the game press enter when the option is selected
	Game:
		You can move the snake using arrow keys and w/s/a/d however I would advise to usde w/s/a/d as
		cmd is not a fan of arrow keys which results in input lag that is replicable on my collegues
		projects.
	HighScore:
		Press enter to go back to the menu
