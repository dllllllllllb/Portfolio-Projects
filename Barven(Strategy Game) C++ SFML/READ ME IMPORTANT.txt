This is still WIP, it has a couple of know bugs (mainly visual although there might be bugs I didn't come acros in my playthroughs and testing)

There is a manual in this folder that explains how to interact with the project

Each document that I contributed to this project on has my name at the top of it (.h and .cpp come in pairs) "Author: Maciej Dowbor"
Every document is mine unless it states otherwise.
All Textures/Sprites are downloaded from the internet. Link: https://www.spriters-resource.com/pc_computer/heroes3/

If you want to open and run the debug version of the project you will need to link SFML liblaries to the project

(there might be some features not shown that I forgot about so feel free to play around with the release version)

Map AI is still in development, didn't have enough time to fully implement it so I focused on things that I could get done.
The game is playable as Hot seat, player vs AI or player vs map monsters.
