This is the very first piece of programming I have done, it was written in October 2019 and
doesn't represent my programming skills. The most resent project I worked on is Barven(Strategy Game) included in this repo.
It is included to show how much progress I've made as a programmer and to have a laugh (platformerCode.js is very "interesting").
